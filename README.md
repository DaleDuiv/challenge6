## Description
Our goal for this week was to develop a Weather Dashboard.
I spent the first week (prior to us doing a group challenge) trying to get it right, however whenever I did my research online, I came into bumps, where every reference would use Jquery.
Being concerned about time and the group project, I adapted the Jquery library and sources to create the weather app.
In the last 3 days I have attempted to create another weather dashboard however I wasn't successful in calling local storage, so I am sticking with this approach.
The design is to create a weather dashboard that shows local storage of previously searched cities, and then you can click those to show the current weeather and 5-day forecast.
We are using OpenWeatherMap api to provide the content of the weather dashboard.
My biggest challenge was to utilize local storage and still have much to learn about it. Even with jquery I wasn't too certain and adapted code and reverse engineered it to suit my situation.
I haven't pushed this until due date (a: for time and forgetfulness) but mostly due to my interests in NOT doing it the Jquery way.
